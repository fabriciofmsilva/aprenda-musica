1. First Daily Objective: Practice Routine
  * My daily practice routine: Start between 4:30 - 5:00 AM. One hour divided into 4 blocks. Blocks/exercises are changing. No free playing, recording, jamming, songwriting. That comes later during the day!
2. Recording Guitar Videos
  * The main benefits: Constant challenge for your playing / technique / theory skills. Sense of accomplishment, feedback from the community. Old reference videos.
3. Taking Jobs Outside Of Your Comfort Zone
  * Don't underestimate what you can do! Take changes and don't always stick to your confort zone as a guitar player. You Will learn the most from challenging jobs/gigs!
4. No More Alcohol / Partying
  * Not having hangovers after long nights keeps me on track and focused on my goals! Try taking a break from drinking once in a while and let me know what you think about this (probably divisive) topic in the comments!
5. Teaching And Solving Student Problems
